# Dave Plummer Portfolio

# Summary

This website is designed as an online portfolio to showcase my skill as a web developer and to serve as a digital resume for employers or those willing to work alongside me. Continuous changes will be made and content added as time progresses and my portfolio builds. 
I will be working too refractor code, provide better accessibility, and create a more dynamic and engaging website with additional and/or new technologies.
